Iris Classification ML Project with DVC Tracking and Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions


Assignment Objective :
Setup IRIS Classification Training pipeline into a GitHub repository with two branches dev and main
Create evaluation and data validation unit tests using pytest or unittest
For evaluation and testing, configure the Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions to fetch the model and data needed for evaluation from DVC configured in Week-3
Push inclusion of pytest code changes to dev branch and raise Pull Request to main branch
Every branch should have its own CI on push or PR merge
Run a sanity test using GitHub actions printing a report as a comment using cml
Files
1. data folder
Key Utilities:
Stores iris.csv data
2. model folder
Key Utilities:
Stores the trained iris classification model
3. src/train.py
Key Utilities:
Loads the iris.csv
Trains a RandomForestClassifier model
4. tests/test_data_validation.py and tests/test_model_evaluation
Key Utilities:
Runs unit tests using pytest on data and model
5. requirements.txt
Key Utilities:
List of required packages for the Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions
6. .github/worflows/ci-dev.yml and .github/worflows/ci-main.yml
Key Utilities:
YAML file for configuring GitHub Actions to perform Continuous Integration (CI)
ci-dev.yml perfroms CI for dev branch on push and pull request
ci-main.yml perfroms CI for main branch on push and pull request
On push, CI for the respective branch will be triggered
On pull request, CI for the both the branch be triggered
Fetches the model and data needed for evaluation from DVC
Runs sanity test and prints report as a comment using cml
7. week4_GA_setup.ipynb
Key Utilities:
Created in Vertex AI workbench
Serves as an interface for performing actions local working directory
Setup Git Repository with dev and main branch
Setup DVC with GCS bucket as remote storage
Created YAML file for GitHub Actions
Pushed the local working directory to remote repo on GitHub
